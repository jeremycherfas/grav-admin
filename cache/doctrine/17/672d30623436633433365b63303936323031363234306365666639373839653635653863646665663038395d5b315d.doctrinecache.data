This much I knew, having researched the topic for <a href="http://www.fornacalia.com/2013/poppyseed-cake/">my poppyseed cake recipe</a>. I never imagined, though, that food could be more than just a little soporific. ABC Radio in Australia hauled Fuschia Dunlop before a microphone to enliven a discussion about the latest news about Chinese cooking. She reminisced:</p>
<p>===</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the afternoon went on we just got more and more relaxed until everyone just felt drowsy. We all went and fell asleep on beds and sofas and I can still remember having this absolutely blissful sleep. When I woke up I went back into the kitchen and I noticed that there were poppy heads bobbing around in the broth.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/gastronomic-addiction-in-china/5999824">ABC's story</a> contains the usual warnings about innocent people failing drug tests, but I found it more interesting for a couple of other points. </p>
<p>First, although banned in 2008, it is still possible to get opiated grub at small, family run restaurants, "thanks to a lack of health and safety oversight".</p>
<p>Then there's the question you know they just had to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it taste like?</p>
<p>‘Under the assault of Szechuan pepper and chillies and black beans and all the other ingredients you wouldn't notice it,’ says Dunlop.</p>
<p>‘It's just another spice, but with a rather interesting effect.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>And finally, I wouldn't be true to myself if I failed to point out that the photo accompanying the audio file, while definitely <strong>a</strong> poppy is definitely not an <strong>opium</strong> poppy.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
