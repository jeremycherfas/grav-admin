<blockquote>
<p>This is a seriously good loaf. I sliced it upside down, as the top crust was a little brittle and I feared it would break up if I attempted to slice it normally. The crumb was dense but not heavy, moist and chewy, with enough rye bitterness and enough sourness too. Great with sweet jam and savoury cheese alike. A keeper.</p>
