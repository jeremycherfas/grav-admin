Looking at posts from 12 years ago -- how time flies -- is bittersweet, but I'm not here to dwell. I'm here to point to <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/GoogleIP.html">a glorious piece from Paul Ford</a>, which I'm very happy to say is still up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, you don't arrive at a morally profound motto like “don't be evil” without some serious thought. Here are some of the mottoes that Google tried out and rejected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google! Dance with the devil, but go home before it gets serious.</li>
<li>Google! We won't commit genocide in most circumstances.</li>
<li>Google! Don't eat no babies.</li>
<li>Google! We could do good, but we're like, whoa.</li>
<li>Google! Begone, demon!</li>
</ul>

<p>I laughed the first time. And I'm still laughing. Especially when you know what Google has become.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
