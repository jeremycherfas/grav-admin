This morning, the street below was dry and so were the taps in the house. Luckily, there was enough old water in the kettle for a cup of tea each (though not the customary two) or else we'd probably be lying there still, parched. Taking the dog out, therefore, I loaded my backpack with an empty 5-litre demijohn and set off.</p>

<p>Luckily, I don't have far to go. One of the joys of Rome is that it is studded with <em>nasone</em>, public fountains that gush delicious, drinkable water. Romans (and ex-pats) will debate the merits of different fountains -- this one is sweeter than that -- but this morning I just went to the one in the park, and having emptied the dog, filled the jug.</p>
<p>I'm therefore declaring solidarity with the women of the world who have to go far further and carry far more, far more often. </p>
<p>I had hoped that the informal exchange of information around the water source, which I'm told is one of the benefits of having to collect and carry water from a well, would tell me what had happened to the water main and when it might be fixed. But there was noone else there.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
