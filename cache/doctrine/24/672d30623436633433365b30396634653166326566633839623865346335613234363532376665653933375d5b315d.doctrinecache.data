a:2:{s:7:"content";s:2123:"<p>Having  gone nuts and done a clean install of El Capitan, I'm trying to recover bits of my working life. Mostly, that is going well. But not with my <a href="http://jeremycherfas.net">main website</a>. I moved that from a well-dodgy WordPress installation to a static site generated by Octopress a few years ago, and while I enjoyed getting that system up and running, I didn't really want to go through it all again. It is just too inflexible for my needs.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Even before the clean install, I had been casting around for a replacement, without lighting on anything. Then, <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/11/wordpress/">a post by Ben Brooks</a> mentioned a CMS new to me: <a href="http://getgrav.org">Grav</a>. I took a look around and liked what I saw, although it did also seem a bit intimidating. But the tutorials are really clear and relatively simple, and I soon had a local version up and running.</p>
<p>That made me like it more. Enough, in fact, to start thinking about transferring all 1413 entries from the archive.</p>
<p>Grav and Octopress both use a special section of front matter to tell the system what to do with the content that follows, and for a while I thought I might attempt to do some fancy stuff and automate converting one to the other. Good sense prevailed. So I went back to the first of the 1413 posts <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> and copied it into my local website.</p>
<p>That worked fine, but I took the opportunity to check the link it contained, and of course it had rotted away. A bit of searching turned up the piece to which the link referred, but that is now behind a paywall. And you know what? That site can go get stuffed.</p>
<p>That blog post will now exist only in my archive, if I decide to keep it. And I will take the opportunity to check each post.</p>
<p>I may be some time.</p>
