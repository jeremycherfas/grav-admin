a:2:{s:7:"content";s:2061:"<p>Over on <a href="http://app.net">ADN</a> a couple of days ago there was a long and convoluted discussion <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> around the general topic of how to reward serious, or high-quality, news-gathering. Many elements are at play, from the nature of "high-quality" to the nature of "reward," and all of them got a good go-around. One of the elements that didn't surface for quite a while, though, was that good news has never been paid for solely by those who consume it. Advertising, government grants, and a few deep pockets have all helped to pay journalists to do their thing. And today?</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Many, many shallow pockets seems to be the way to go. Much of the discussion talked about micro-payments and ways to make it easy to pay a little to the creators of content you appreciate. Such systems would indeed be a wonderful start. The big problem, for me, is to put my work in front of a large enough group of people, and <a href="http://jeremycherfas.re-app.net/2013/09/25/what-i-need-to-earn-on-the-internet/">I said as much</a> in a response to a question from one of the ace developers who hangs about on ADN. <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> I publish my podcasts, and link to them when an opportunity arises, but I confess I am not much of a one for relentless self-promotion. Same goes for stuff I write. Frankly, I don't care to market myself as much as perhaps I ought. So, what I need from any platform that is going to make it easy for people to pay me is not the payments as much as the recommendations. </p>
<p>I need a word-of-mouth amplifier.</p>
<p>Would that work?</p>
