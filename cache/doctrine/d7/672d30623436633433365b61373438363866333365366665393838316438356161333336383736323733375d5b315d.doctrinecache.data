<p>===</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type all your tweets into a single text view. Stormcrow will automatically separate your paragraphs into a thread of automatically-numbered tweets. Publish them all at once at the tap of a button. Spend less time futzing with reply buttons and counting tweets, and focus on what youâ€™re trying to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have the greatest respect for Jared's app Riposte, which is the bee's knees for interacting with pnut and ADN before it, and I'm sure he is meeting a need for many people. But sheesh, if you want to write a blog post, write a blog post, not a flock of tweets, no matter how orderly.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
