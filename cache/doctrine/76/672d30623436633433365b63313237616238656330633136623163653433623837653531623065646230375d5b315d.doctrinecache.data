<p>@lukasros, who started the conversation running, posted <a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/inside-instagram-algorithm">a link with more details today</a>. It contained a report by Thomas Dimson of Instagram on how why and how they built and scaled the algorithm. For me, this is the money quote.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dimson says that in their research, they found that Instagram users weren’t seeing around 70% of the content matched to them in the chronological feed. The solution to this, according to Dimson, is to either get people to follow fewer users, ensuring they always see the content most relevant to them, or to implement an algorithm to highlight the content they’re most likely to engage with, based on the aforementioned factors.</p>
<p>The first option isn't feasible, ...</p>

<p>And that's what brought me up short. Of course Instagram doesn't want "people to follow fewer users," but that is the only sense in which the option isn't feasible. If, however, I have chosen to follow only a few users, wouldn't it be nice to allow me to choose whether to implement the algorithm?</p>
