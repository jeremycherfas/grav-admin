You bung the seeds in to damp compost, you keep them a bit warm and -- Bam! -- new life. Keeping a lid on my impatience can be hard, and in my current set-up is especially dangerous because there is nowhere that is both warm and light. A day of neglect results in spindly stems that will never amount to much. But when its right, it is so right, and in this instance is particularly warming because I promised to raise these plants for a friend who, I think, is currently floundering around the Caribbean on a yacht, poor thing. Have fun Joanne, your seeds are safe with me.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
