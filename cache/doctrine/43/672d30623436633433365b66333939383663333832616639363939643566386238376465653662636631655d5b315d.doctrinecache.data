<p>Normally I find out about these things too late to do anything about it. So I'm actually grateful to Eattiamo -- who'll send a box of Italian goodies to your doorstep, if you're in the USA -- for pointing out that 25 October happens to be both World Pasta Day and two months and a day since the earthquake that brought the town of Amatrice down. What better way to kill two birds with one stone <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> than to eat pasta all'Amatriciana that day and donate a little more to restoring the town?</p>
<p>While the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/25/491370926/food-world-rallies-for-quake-hit-amatrice-home-of-famous-pasta-dish">initial response was huge</a>, Eattiamo reminds us that memories fade fast, and so wants people to do it all over again.</p>
<p>Obviously Eattiamo would like you to <a href="https://us.eattiamo.com/world-pasta-day-pasta-allamatriciana-amatrice">order your meal from them</a> but if you don't fancy that they've got plenty of other ideas of how to celebrate.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.worldpastaday2016.org">big shindig</a> this year is in Moscow. I'll be ignoring that for sure, but I will be eating for Amatrice.</p>
