<p>After considerable soul-searching and head scratching I decided to switch away from <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/">Tinderbox</a> for publishing my whole blog and move to something a little more focussed. So here I am on WordPress, impressed. I may well continue to use write and publish, but will definitely not be maintaining the static pages that I was generating before. Lots of things to do, as ever when playing with a new toy.</p>

<li>Import some -- or all ? -- old posts from Tinderbox </li>
<li>Work on the layout and stylesheets</li>
<li>Think about links</li>
<li>Work on an image gallery</li>
