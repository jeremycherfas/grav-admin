<p>When I was young, we didn't have English gooseberries (<em>Ribes uva-crispa</em>). We had Cape Gooseberries (<em>Physalis peruviana</em>) although it was not for another lifetime that I learned that not everybody called them that. And we had Chinese gooseberries (<em>Actinidia deliciosa</em>). Then along came a marketing genius and lo, the faintly suspect Chinese gooseberry (think Cold War Red Menace) stormed the USA and later Europe as the kiwi fruit.</p>
