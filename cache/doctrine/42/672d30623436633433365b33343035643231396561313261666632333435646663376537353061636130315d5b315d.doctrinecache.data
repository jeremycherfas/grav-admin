Especially when, as with this latest attempt on Typepad they can't seem to do it right. So maybe I can use that as an opportunity to do more here. <sup id="fnref1:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This cheffy bloke, Jeremy Shapiro, <a href="http://www.stirthepots.com/2013/10/grano-arso-burnt-wheat.html">recently wrote</a> about making his own <em>grano arso</em> by toasting some durum flour "to a nutty brown colour" and then baking a fairly rustic loaf with it. Which, of course, reminded me of my own experiments along these lines, <a href="http://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/flaming-flour-whets-my-appetite">back in 2011</a>. And then I realized that although I <a href="http://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/more-on-burnt-flour/">got the flour</a>, and baked a couple of loaves with it, I never actually wrote it up. Or, if I did, I can't find it. My brain is like that these days.</p>
<p>As I recall it was really rather good. Maybe I left myself some notes.</p>
