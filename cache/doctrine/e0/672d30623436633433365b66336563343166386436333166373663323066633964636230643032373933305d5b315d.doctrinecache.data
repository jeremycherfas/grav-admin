The reason I have several homes is that perhaps people who are interested in bread aren't interested in podcasts, and <em>vice versa</em>, while maybe people who come here aren't interested in either.</p>
<p>So a while ago I resolved to maintain those separate presences, and to use this place as the kind of mother ship, where I can do things that are neither bread nor podcasting and also briefly mention things I've done elsewhere. But I have also neglected to do that last thing. I am resolved to change that.</p>
<p>So, over at Fornacalia, there's <a href="http://www.fornacalia.com/2014/another-kalonji-bread-to-bump-me-out-of-my-rut/">a recipe for a kalonji and raisin bread</a> that I invented last week to try and jounce me out of my current bread-baking rut. </p>
<p>And at Eat This Podcast, a week ago I interviewed Colin Khoury about the <a href="http://www.eatthispodcast.com/the-global-standard-diet/">The Global Standard Diet</a>.</p>
<p>I've also changed what both those sites look like, with more or less success.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
