<p>Some very smart people have been having a right old ding-dong over how big a phone is and how small a tablet is and this mythical creature called a phablet. Little of which I can relate to, as I don't have a tablet and my phone is a fine size for me. But I certainly can relate more generally.</p>

<p>I've always liked pen and paper as my main form of outboard memory. One reason is that, while I have nothing like a photographic memory, I do have a kind of visual memory that tells me that the information I'm looking for was written in blue ink on the page with a coffee stain. Another is that I find the physical act of writing something down helps to preserve it in a way that, say, typing does not. Also, while it <em>can</em> become geeky in the extreme, it doesn't have to be, and in most social circumstances is far less geeky than anything electronic. <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><img alt="" class="left" src="/grav-admin/user/pages/03.blog/40.form-factor-fun/cohle-notebook.jpg" /> To get back to phones and tablets, I've also always had two form factors for my paper. The phone used to be, and sometimes still is, a stack of index cards, although now it is more often a small (9x14 cm) notebook. The tablet is an A5 bound notebook, Clairefontaine for preference when I can find them. And while there are people who manage to carry an even bigger tablet around with them most of the time, I don't except when I have a bag of some sort. When I do, though, I like having the tablet with me. And when I don't, I sometimes forget to transfer from the phone to the tablet. </p>
<p>All of which is of supremely little general interest, I'm sure, as is the fact that I've decided to try and give the <a href="http://www.bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a> approach a try. So far, I like it as a good and useful combination of task list and journal. But it does need a tablet, not a phone.</p>

<p>Having said which, I did at one time try to develop the habit of using my phone to record very brief memory-jogging audio notes. That's good on the go, but I need to somehow make it a lot easier.&#160;<a href="#fnref1:1" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">&#8617;</a></p>
