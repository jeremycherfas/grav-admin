a:2:{s:7:"content";s:3270:"<p>Yesterday brought a tweet with an interesting angle on a scientific development. Accompanied by a herd of <a href="https://tineye.com/search/69e2fa6270890da85a98b44a93abe467a6a310e3/?extension_ver=">stockphoto cows</a>, John Blue of Truffle Media <a href="https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/826782663017111552">tweeted</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"CRISPR-Cas9 used to create genetically Tuberculosis-resistant cows could be 1st #antibiotic free livestock"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Killjoy that I am, I <a href="https://twitter.com/EatPodcast/status/826790908943331328">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I reckon they'll still get antibiotics to promote growth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Blue <a href="https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/826950500629303301">reminded me</a> that US FDA regulations now say that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Antibiotics cannot be used for production, e.g., growth promotion, purposes"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I first <a href="https://twitter.com/EatPodcast/status/827044645720956928">asked</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Is the use of antibiotics for production now zero?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, after getting a link as a reply, asked again, quoting the bit of the article he linked to, which said that ""the use of antibiotics for growth promotion be halted by 2016"</p>
<p>John's <a href="https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/826950849238810624">answer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you want to interview someone   about #antibiotics in #ag let me know"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing if not a pain in the arse, I <a href="https://twitter.com/EatPodcast/status/827441962621997056">asked again</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So, routine use in production is now zero?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John <a href="https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/827197024978268161">replied</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sick animals can still receive proper veterinary care via judicious use of #antibiotics"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is nice, and all, but. Today brought <a href="https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/827492835075223553">another reply</a> to the same question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"@EatPodcast to help, can you clear up what you mean by "routine use" &amp; #antibiotics? If you'd like, I'll connect you w/ a veterinary expert"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At which point I think I'll just shut up. And it seemed such a simple question.</p>
