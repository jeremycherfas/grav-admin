<p>I can't actually be sure that today is the day, because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curio_maximus">Curio Maximus</a> hasn't actually announced it. But today is the last day it could possibly be. So I'm celebrating in the simplest possible way, by baking bread with only three ingredients: flour, water and salt. Oh, and the squillions of things that bestir my 100% hydration natural leaven.</p>

<p>It would be nice to know more about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornacalia">Fornacalia</a> than the little I gleaned from Wikipedia in English. Still, better than the <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornacalia">Italian</a>. And then there are the supremely puzzling links between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax_(mythology)">Fornax</a>, Goddess of the Oven, <sup id="fnref1:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_prostitutionnotes2.htm#Fornix">fornices</a>, where one could hire a hot babe, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornix">fornices</a> cerebral and otherwise, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081104002314/http://sacred-sex.org/terminology/fornication">fornication</a>. <sup id="fnref1:fn2"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> Not to mention buns in ovens. The modern constellation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax">Fornax</a> is clearly of little relevance. One could, however, clearly spend a lifetime exploring these particular rabbit holes.</p>
