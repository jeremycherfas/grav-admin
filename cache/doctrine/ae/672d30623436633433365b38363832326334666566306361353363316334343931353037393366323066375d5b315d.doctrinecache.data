a:2:{s:7:"content";s:2034:"<p>Ask anyone with a passing interest in the history of Italian food about the origins of <em>spaghetti alla carbonara</em> and you'll likely get one of two answers. Coal miners (more properly, charcoal burners) or American GIs adding bacon and eggs to pasta in 1944. The very erudite might cite a mention for pasta with egg and cheese in an 1839 book by Ippolito Cavalcanti.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> Heck, if you had asked me before breakfast this morning, I would probably have cited the charcoal burners. I now know better, thanks to a couple of fascinating pieces by Jeremy Parzen.</p>

<p>I won't steal his thunder; read for yourself his <a href="http://dobianchi.com/2012/10/29/carbonara-origin-name-meaning/">new theory for the origins and name of the dish</a>, which I happened across because he recently published a <a href="http://dobianchi.com/2014/02/10/carbonara-meaning-origin/">kind of update</a>, talking about the influence of returning emigrants on Italian cuisine. While you're there marvel, as I did, at the offensive tenacity with which people hold on to the things they "know" to be true, despite being presented with actual evidence of a more plausible account. More plausible to me, at any rate.</p>
<p>Carbonara did not really surface in my recent <a href="http://www.eatthispodcast.com/pasta/">podcast with Maureen Fant</a>, co-author of <em>Sauces and Shapes: Pasta the Italian Way</em>, except as a once-fashionable dish. And there's no real need to know exactly where the dish came from in order to enjoy it. But it will give me something to discuss as I daintily twirl a delicious strand or two.</p>
