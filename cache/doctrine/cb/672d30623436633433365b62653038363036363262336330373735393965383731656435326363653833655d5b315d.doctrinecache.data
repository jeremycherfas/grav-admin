For one thing, there have been quite a few tweaks under the hood that aren't visible but that do make a difference to what is visible. For another, there's the somewhat daunting task of bringing over the ±1400 posts from the old site and trying to make sure that links from the old site end up on the correct page here.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>This last I finally accomplished this morning, thanking to one of my ever-helpful friends at <a href="http://alpha.dot.net">ADN</a>. And what prompted that was an ill-advised visit to Google Analytics, which showed that external links to several of my most popular posts were leading nowhere. So that's where I focussed my attention this week bringing over a dozen or so posts on everything from <a href="/grav-admin/blog/a-taste-of-big-mike">Big Mike bananas</a> to <a href="/grav-admin/blog/distinct-asian-pussies">Asian pussies</a>.</p>
<p>Because it wouldn't do to let the Googlers down in their search for erudition.</p>
<p>The more difficult question is how -- or even whether -- to put these link-checked, spruced up blog entries out there. On balance, they're probably best ignored. Only ±1350 to go.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
