There were, for example, several tags that had a value of 0px. It is so easy to do stylesheets in a suck-it-and-see kind of way by sticking a quick border around a division to visualize it on-screen, or adding a swift wash of background-color. Then, when everything is fine, rather than remove the border completely, I just set it to 0px. Or a whole Div that once seemed vital no longer serves any purpose. And over the aeons of internet time, debris like that accumulates; the pseudogenes of the stylesheet.</p>
