There was to be a little party here, and I had set my heart on serving  Bloody Marys, even though it was Saturday and for some reason I associate Bloody Marys indelibly with Sunday mornings. By Friday night I had assembled all the fixings, bar one. No tomato juice was to be had, not even for ready money. I had tried two supermarkets and three alimentari, and nobody had tomato juice. Aisles full of passata and other such pomodorous  things. But no juice.</p>
<p>I almost gave up. Adversity then brought out the best in me, as I realized that transforming tomato into tomato juice couldn't be that difficult. So I bought a couple of kilos of the biggest, juiciest tomatoes I could find, and spent yesterday morning skinning, liquidizing and forcing them through a sieve. The pure juice was delicious enough, in a fresh and rather bland way. With all the fixings it was really rather good. The Bloody Marys themselves were, though I say so as shouldn't, a minor triumph. I suspect that from now on I shall become a Bloody Mary bore, banging on about how essential it is to use fresh tomato juice, and will always do so myself. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>The Virgin Marys were bloody good again this morning.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
