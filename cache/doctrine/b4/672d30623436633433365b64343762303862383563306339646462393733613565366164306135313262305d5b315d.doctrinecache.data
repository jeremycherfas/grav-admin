In pursuit of doing something new and different, I got completely stuck in <em>how</em> to do it instead of <em>what</em> to do. Classic prevarication. Figure out a way to make the process more efficient before I have even decided what the outcome of the process should be. So I spent the better part of an hour futzing around with Workflow on the iPhone to see whether I could send some information directly to a nascent bit of <em>what</em>. And why? Because simply emailing the information and then using that as the basis for a bit of <em>what</em> seemed clumsy. It isn't.</p>
<p>Well, it is, but it will at least get the job done.</p>
<p>At least, it will if I let myself let it.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
