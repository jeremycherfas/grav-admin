In the <a href="http://www.eatthispodcast.com/how-to-bake-bread-in-a-microwave-oven/#comments">comments to the podcast on microwaved bread</a>, Peter Hertzmann elaborates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not wise to put small pieces of metal in a microwave, such as the twist-tie on a plastic bag. Large pieces are another issue. I’ve been putting large stainless-steel bowls in my microwave ever since I worked in a restaurant in Switzerland in 2002 where we regularly warmed items in 2-liter metal bowls. The metal actually acts as a reflector, reflecting radiant energy from the magnetron tube into the food in the bowl.</p>

<p>As I keep saying, I don't have a microwave to try this sort of thing. Or to experiment with re-heating bread, which everyone agrees is best done by controlling the on-off cycle of the microwave, giving a chance for the heat generated to spread slowly by conduction through the bread. That could also help to reduce hot-spots. </p>
<p>Ken Albala, subject of the podcast, is quick to <a href="http://www.eatthispodcast.com/how-to-bake-bread-in-a-microwave-oven/#comment-1100">defend dissing the bread machine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only reason I dismissed the bread machine is that it really doesn’t do anything else and takes up space. I’m very much against single purpose gadgets, or giving people a recipe and making them buy another machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he says he's going to continue to experiment on the recipe for microwavable bread -- "a little fat in the dough might really make a difference".</p>
<p>And William Rubel, author of a great little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1861898541/">global history of bread</a>, <a href="http://www.eatthispodcast.com/how-to-bake-bread-in-a-microwave-oven/#comment-1088">really gets</a> what Ken is trying to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point that I take away from Ken’s experiment is that with essentially no fiddling he baked a credible loaf. ... I think we need to let go and ask not whether a microwave bread is “as good as” or “the same as” in flavor, crust, and crumb than a loaf baked in a bath of hot air but rather, can we transform bread dough in a microwave into something wonderful. I think it is pretty clear from Ken’s comments that that is more of the direction of his experimenting.</p>

<p>Finally, there's this thing called <a href="http://podcastawards.com/">The Podcast Awards</a>, now in it's 9th year, nominations for which opened last week. There are many, many (22?) categories, including both Food and Drink and Science. I don't think Eat This Podcast fits squarely into either of those, though it could be wedged into both at a push. I think it is more about how our  food and drink comes into being, which sometimes involves a bit of science. It definitely is not about the latest hot restaurant, chef or cocktailista. Anyway, if you felt minded to go and nominate <a href="http://eatthispodcast.com">Eat This Podcast</a>, and any other podcasts you like, and ultimately to vote, I would count it a singular honour; win, lose or draw. Nominations close on 23 October, and voting opens on 1 November. Fear not, I'll remind you. </p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
