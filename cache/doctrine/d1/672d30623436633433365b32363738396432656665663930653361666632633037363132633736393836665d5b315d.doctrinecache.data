<p>My own employer is not immune, but as I've moaned myself, that's not my fault, though with luck it will be, soon. In the meantime, this rant is occasioned by my need for a decent file of the UNDP logo, preferably a scalable EPS with proper colour information. Is that so much to ask for? I thought not.
