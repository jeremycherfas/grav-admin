<p>there's like 3 steps to update my site. it takes me 5 minutes to write a paragraph, but 10 minutes to upload it to my site</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That little snippet appeared last night in the notes from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club">Homebrew Web Club</a> meeting in Portland, and it sang out to me. My site is the same, and at least part of that is my own fault. Everything happens first on a local copy of the website. Then I upload changes to github. Github sends the changes to the live site. And then, with luck, they appear on the live site.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>It's set up this way because at the start, when I was working with a new CMS, almost everything I did broke something and I didn't want that mess exposed in public. Now, though, aside from one or two larger itches I need to scratch, I'm more or less done with tinkering. I'm still nervous about dealing direct with the live site. I could, easily enough. I could even just create things entirely by hand, avoiding the CMS post creation entirely and leaving it to github to do the needful, but I don't.</p>
<p>One reason, I think, is that I don't have a deep enough understanding of github. Although I treat my local copy as the canonical version, I know it isn't, really. That's the version on github. The live site is as much a copy as my local site. I worry now that if I make changes directly to the live site (as opposed to making changes in github) The two copies will get completely out of step, and I have no idea how to reverse the magic that allows github to push changes to the live site.</p>
<p>All that, however, is no excuse for not continuing the tedious job of bringing in old posts from previous incarnations, except that maybe I am avoiding that because I deep down I am thinking about changing back to a platform more suited to writing.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
