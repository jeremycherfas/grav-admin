It was difficult work, but ultimately worthwhile, and in pursuit of my goal to maintain a record of my other online activities here, I'm linking to <a href="http://www.fornacalia.com/2013/sourdough-ciabatta/">sourdough ciabatta</a>.</p>
<p>This also raises the question of what to do about plurals of foreign words. It drives me a teeny bit nuts when movie characters, and ordinary people, ask for "a biscotti" or "a panini". So should I maintain my pedantic persona and refer to <em>ciabatte</em> when I'm talking about several ciabattas?</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
