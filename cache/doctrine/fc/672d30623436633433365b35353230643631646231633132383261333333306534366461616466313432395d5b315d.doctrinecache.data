<p>We didn't try that, having been tempted instead by a local pasta, whose name I inconveniently forgot to note, and the plain grilled sea bass.</p>
<p>Among other delights, visits to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Cimbrone">Villa Cimbrone</a> and, even more thrilling, to Gore Vidal's home at La Rondinaia. Further documentation will have to wait.</p>
<p>But the really deep thought is this: why is it that on a narrow urban street, designed for maybe two lanes of traffic in either direction, Italians will somehow use three, while on a broad stretch of motorway, with three fine lanes available, all the traffic will be in the leftmost lane, while the right will be empty?</p>
