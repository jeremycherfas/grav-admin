a:2:{s:7:"content";s:1386:"<p>Rex's <a href="http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-701.cfm">longer article</a> this week is, as he puts it, about "game culture -- and how it intersects with movies, music, and digital communication". A very interesting collection of thoughts. and even though I have never really been into computer games (except for a brief flirtation with RSI when Tetris first came out) I'm intrigued by his take on things. Especially the idea of blogging or doing iTunes playlists as a kind of computer game.</p>

<p>He also mentions a new PBS series on the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/index.html">history of viedogaming</a> which reminded me of a wonderful book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0446375217/104-3970239-0027908?v=glance">Pilgrim in the Microworld</a>. A very detailed account of how one person learned to play the most primitive computer game, I remember it as a fascinating read. And I see that David Sudnow has also rewritten the other book I know him for, Ways of the Hand, which is about learning to play jazz piano.</p>
