<p>One problem is that the primary cause of my current lack of both time and motivation is out of bounds for moaning. I have promised the powers that be that I won't discuss my work on my blog, it being far easier to self-censor than to explain. So I won't even indulge in a little <em>Roman a clef</em> and disguise names to protect the guilty. Let's just say that life is not entirely smooth at present.</p>

<p>There's been something on my mind too, to write about. To do with agricultural subsidies and such. But it is just going to have to wait.</p>

<p>11 September 2016: The link is not dead, but the page contains no content. It was about <a href="http://www.particletree.com/features/visualizing-fittss-law/">Fitt's Law</a>, which is mostly intuitive, but is interesting to see spelled out, and which continues to guide me in making links longer rather than shorter. Good to know too that I've updated my post here, even if <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2004/september">Gruber</a> hasn't bothered..&#160;<a href="#fnref1:1" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">&#8617;</a></p>
